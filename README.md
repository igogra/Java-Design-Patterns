#Java Design Patterns

Design Patterns are well-proved solutions for solving common known problems. But design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems. That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable. You should use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
