Behavioral Design Patterns
==========================

Behavioral Design Patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. In these design patterns the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled. That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
